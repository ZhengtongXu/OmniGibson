# üå°Ô∏è **Object States**

## Description

In **`OmniGibson`**, `ObjectState`s define kinematic (such as `OnTop`, or `Inside`) or semantic (such as `Temperature` or `Saturated`) states for a given `StatefulObject`. These states enable finer-grained description of the scene at hand not captured by the raw simulation state (such as object and joint poses).

Every `StatefulObject` owns its own dictionary of states `obj.states`, which maps the object state _class type_ to the object state _instance_ owned by the object.

Object states have a unified API interface: a getter `state.get_value(...)`, and a setter `state.set_value(...)`. Note that not all object states implement these functions:

- Some states such as `Temperature` implement both `get_value()` and `set_value()` as a simple R/W operation, as this is merely an internal variable that is tracked over time.
- Other states implement more complex behavior such as `OnTop`, which infers spatial relationships between different objects during `get_value()` and additional samples poses in `set_value()` such that the spatial relationship is true.
- Some states such as `NextTo` only implement `get_value()`, since setting these states are non-trivial and unclear to sample.
- Finally, `IntrinsicObjectState`s such as `ParticleApplier` (which describes an object that can generate particles, such as a spray bottle) describe an intrinsic semantic property of the object, and therefore do not implement `get_value` nor `set_value`.

**`OmniGibson`** supports a wide range of object state types, and provides an extensive example suite showcasing individual object states. For more information, check out our [object state examples](../getting_started/examples.md#object-states).

## Usage

### Adding Object States

Object states are intended to be added when an object is instantiated, during its constructor call via the `abilities` kwarg. This is expected to be a dictionary mapping ability name to a dictionary of keyword-arguments that dictate the instantiated object state's behavior. Normally, this is simply the keyword-arguments to pass to the specific `ObjectState` constructor, but this can be different. Concretely, the raw values in the `abilities` value dictionary are postprocessed via the specific object state's `postprocess_ability_params` classmethod. This is to allow `abilities` to be fully exportable in .json format, without requiring complex datatypes (which may be required as part of an object state's actual constructor) to be stored.

By default, `abilities=None` results in an object's abilities directly being inferred from its `category` kwarg. **`OmniGibson`** leverages a crowdsourced [knowledgebase](https://behavior.stanford.edu/knowledgebase/categories/index.html) to determine what abilities (or "properties" in the knowledgebase) a given entity (called "synset" in the knowledgebase) can have. Every category in **`OmniGibson`**'s asset dataset directly corresponds to a specific synset. By going to the knowledgebase and clicking on the corresponding synset, one can see the annotated abilities (properties) for that given synset, which will be applied to the object being created.

Alternatively, you can programmatically observe which abilities, with the exact default kwargs, correspond to a given category via:

```python3
from omnigibson.utils.bddl_utils import OBJECT_TAXONOMY
category = "apple"      # or any other category
synset = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_synset_from_category(category)
abilities = OBJECT_TAXONOMY.get_abilities(synset)
```

??? warning annotate "Not all object states are guaranteed to be created!"

    Some object states (such as `ParticleApplier` or `ToggledOn`) potentially require specific metadata to be defined for a given object model before the object state can be created. For example, `ToggledOn` represents a pressable virtual button, and requires this button to be defined a-priori in the raw object asset before it is imported. When parsing the `abilities` dictionary, each object state runs a compatibilty check via `state.is_compatible(obj, **kwargs)` before it is created, where `**kwargs` define any relevant keyword arguments that would be passed to the object state constructor. If the check fails, then the object state is **_not_** created!

### Runtime

As mentioned earlier, object states can be potentially read from via `get_state(...)` or written to via `set_state(...)`. The possibility of reading / writing, as well as the arguments expected and return value expected depends on the specific object state class type. For example, object states that inherit the `BooleanStateMixin` class expect `get_state(...)` to return and `set_state(...)` to receive a boolean. `AbsoluteObjectState`s are agnostic to any other object in the scene, and so `get_state()` takes no arguments. In contrast, `RelativeObjectState`s are computed with respect to another object, and so require `other_obj` to be passed into the getter and setter, e.g., `get_state(other_obj)` and `set_state(other_obj, ...)`. A `ValueError` will be raised if a `get_state(...)` or `set_state(...)` is called on an object that does not support that functionality. If `set_state()` is called and is successful, it will return `True`, otherwise, it will return `False`. For more information on specific object state types' behaviors, please see [Object State Types](#object-state-types).

It is important to note that object states are usually queried / computed _on demand_ and immediately cached until its value becomes stale (usually the immediately proceeding simulation step). This is done for efficiency reasons, and also means that object states are usually not automatically updated per-step unless absolutely necessary (1). Calling `state.clear_cache()` forces a clearing of an object state's internal cache.

## Object State Types
**`OmniGibson`** currently supports 34 object states, consisting of 19 `AbsoluteObjectState`s, 11 `RelativeObjectState`s, and 4 `InstrinsicObjectState`s. Below, we provide a brief overview of each type:

### `AbsoluteObjectState`
These are object states that are agnostic to other objects in a given scene.

### `RelativeObjectState`
These are object states that are computed with respect to other entities in the given scene, and therefore, both the `get_state(...)` and `set_state(...)` take in additional arguments.

### `IntrinsicObjectState`
These are object states that that define intrinsic properties of the object and therefore do not implement `get_state(...)` nor `set_state(...)`.

            [**`ParticleApplier` / `ParticleRemover`**](../reference/object_states/particle_modifier.html)<br><br>  
            Defines an object that has the ability to apply (spawn) or remove (absorb) particles from specific particle systems. This state's `conditions` property defines the per-particle system requirements in order for the applier / remover to be active for that specific system. For example, a spray bottle that is a `ParticleApplier` may require `toggled_on.get_value()` to be `True` in order to allow `cleaning_fluid` particles to be sprayed, simulating a "press" of the nozzle trigger. The `method` flag in the constructor determines the applier / removal behavior, which is triggered **_only_** by direct contact with the object (`ParticleModifyMethod.ADJACENCY`) or contact with a virtual volume (`ParticleModifyMethod.PROJECTION`). The former captures objects such as sponges, while the latter captures objects such as vacuum cleaners or spray bottles. This object state is updated at each simulation step such that particles are automatically added / removed as needed.<br><br>

            Defines an object that has the ability to apply (spawn) or remove (absorb) particles from specific particle systems. The behavior is nearly identical to **`ParticleApplier` / `ParticleRemover`**, with the exception that contact is not strictly necessary to add / remove particles. This is to provide the distinction between, e.g., a particle _source_ such as a sink, which always spawns water every timestep irregardless of whether its faucet volume is in contact with a surface, vs. a particle _applier_ such as a spray bottle, which (for efficiency reasons) only spawns water if its virtual spray cone is overlapping with a surface.<br><br>
